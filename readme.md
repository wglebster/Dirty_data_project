# Dirty Data Project

This is a project I completed as part of my Data Analytics class with CodeClan.

To complete this Project I cleaned two quite messy datasets.
I also analysed the output data according to the Project brief.
This project was performed in R language, mostly using Tidyverse package.

The tasks are numbered Task 1 and Task 4.
