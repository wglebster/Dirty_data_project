Gleb project feedback


Task 1

Positives 

Data cleaning
- Really well commented!
- Nice concise pipeline in cleaning script

Analysis
- Nice writing around analysis
- Overall really well done on task, all questions answered correctly and cleaning script is effective!


Potential improvements

Data cleaning
- Need to library(tidyverse) in cleaning script, otherwise won’t work!
- Could use ‘janitor::clean_names()’ instead of ‘rename_with(~ tolower(gsub(".", "_", .x, fixed = TRUE)))’

Analysis
- Don’t need to read in data for every question in analysis, read it into a variable in a second chunk and then use that variable or subsetted versions of that variable throughout.


Task 4

Positives 

Data cleaning
- Great folder structure and nice to see a README for the project!

Analysis
- Overall very good job! Nice writing around analysis and consistently well-commented throughout!
- Nice use of inline code to print results in knitted version!

Potential improvements

Data cleaning
- Same as task 1, could have used clean_names() instead of very extensive gsub code, could also use regex to remove some common patterns
- You would want to pivot longer candy names instead of having ~100 columns of different candy names

Analysis
- When calculating the number of ratings, your code (just counting rows * cols) is including missing values so the real number of ratings is actually lower (could pivot_longer in cleaning script, then filter missing ratings and count that)
- For your question 6, could have grouped by gender instead of writing separate code for each year (although both ways work) - same with country and year in the two following questions
